- **Get the code:** Download or clone this repository.
- **Change directory:** Move into the the directory where you downloaded or cloned this repository.
- **Install Anaconda:** One of the easiest way to setup necessary Python modules, is to install Anaconda. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
- **Create an Anaconda environment:** Once you installed Anaconda on your machine, create an environment which includes all the necessary Python modules. Run the following command in your terminal:
`conda create --name <your-env-name> --file /path/to/requirements.txt`
- **Activate Anaconda environment:** After the all the necessary Python modules get downloaded and installed. Activate the environment that you recently build, using the following command:
`conda activate <your-env-name>`.
- **Jupyter notebook:** Now check that you are still in the directory where all the code lies. Now, fire up your Jupyter notebook by writing, `jupyter notebook`.

Now you are ready to run this code on your local machine. If you face any problems during setup or while building models, feel free to ask about it. Happy coding!
